# Jupyter Meets the Earth


This is the project home for the EarthCube-funded project (Awards [1928406](https://nsf․gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928406) and [1928374](https://nsf․gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928374)):
_Jupyter meets the Earth: Enabling discovery in geoscience through interactive computing at scale._

## Project description

The [Jupyter meets the Earth project](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-meets-the-earth-1b0eb33c83f?source=friends_link&sk=945065ffe0c101b6c8ec369425574600) combines research use cases in geosciences with technical developments within the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/) ecosystems. In this model of equal partners, scientific questions help drive software infrastructure development, and new technologies expand the horizons of viable research.

The full project description is available in the [original grant proposal](https://zenodo.org/record/3369939).
